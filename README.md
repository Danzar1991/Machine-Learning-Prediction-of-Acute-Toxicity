# Machine-Learning-Prediction-of-Acute-Toxicity
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with experiments related to predicting the forecast acute intraperitoneal toxicity in mice. The study leverages machine learning regression models trained on LD50 data extracted from scientific literature and the ChemIDplus database to forecast acute  intraperitoneal toxicity in mice.
